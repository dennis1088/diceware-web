# Diceware Web App

Diceware is a method of creating a strong and secure passphrase. A passphrase is a set of words or characters that is used to verify your identity in a system. This method starts by either having you roll one die five times or rolling a set of 5 dice once. Then you take the combined results of your dice roll and use the number to lookup a word in a diceware word list. This word will become a word in your passphrase. Repeat this process until youâ€™ve reached the amount of desired words.

This method of choosing a passphrase is not only secure but incredibly simple making it an ideal method for creating such passwords. Passphrases of this form are also easier for a person to memorize as well since. Memorizing `quibble-styling-anglican` is much easier than `o8mtKYARrN%V`. This application generates passphrases using the above method. It also allows some extra settings as some authentication systems require either capital letters and/or a number as well.
